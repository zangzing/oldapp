# ---------- Mar 14 Facebook Auth (450)
Hi everyone,

Sharing to Facebook is now enabled. You can turn the Facebook switch ON when you add photos to post them on your timeline, use the share message to add some context. If you want to stream every photo to Facebook, create a new album and turn its Facebook switch ON at creation time. Each time you add photos, they will be posted to your timeline.

Remember, if you have any problems, please send us a note to help@zangzing.com

# ------- Mar 2 2012 Album Sharing/Groups (400)

Hi everyone,

Thanks for the ongoing help in testing our iPhone app. This latest release has two really great things that we'd love for you to try out.

1. Take Photos, Create New Albums and Share
Once you tap the yellow camera icon, take a photo and tap upload, you can now choose to create a new album and share it via email! From the upload screen, simply tap 'Choose or Create New Album' and then in the top, tap 'New Album'. From there you can name the album, set the privacy and share via email. (Facebook and Twitter are up next). Whoever you invite via email will be remembered. Also, any time you add new photos to that album, that list of people will be emailed letting them know about the new photos. 

2. Saving Groups
One other thing that we've added is the ability to create a group of people via Email and save them as a Group. Any Group can then be easily used over and over again for all your album sharing. 

By the way, if you are new to the iPhone app, you can sign in under the Me button with your existing ZangZing account. We don't support creating new accounts just yetâ€¦

Thanks for trying it out and please send bugs, feedback, questions to us at help@zangzing.com
